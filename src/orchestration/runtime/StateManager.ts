/**
 * @file StateManager.ts
 * @description Manages the mutable {@link GraphState} partitions for an active graph run.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *  - Creating a clean initial state from caller-supplied input.
 *  - Applying node output patches to the `scratch` partition, honoring per-field
 *    {@link StateReducers} for deterministic conflict resolution.
 *  - Applying node output patches to the `artifacts` partition (last-write-wins by default).
 *  - Merging states produced by parallel branches using the same reducer logic.
 *  - Tracking the ordered list of visited node ids and the global iteration counter.
 *
 * `StateManager` is intentionally stateless between calls — it receives the current
 * {@link GraphState} as an argument and returns a *new* object; it never mutates in place.
 * This makes it straightforward to unit-test and safe to use in concurrent contexts.
