/**
 * @file routing-tables.ts
 * @description Preset routing tables for {@link MemoryRouter}.
 *
 * The MemoryRouter dispatches each query to one of the available
 * {@link MemoryBackendId} backends based on the classifier-predicted
 * {@link MemoryQueryCategory}. The mapping from category to backend is a
 * "routing table" — a frozen object that callers can pass through unchanged
 * for the shipping defaults, or override per-category for custom workloads.
 *
 * Three preset tables ship out of the box, each calibrated from Phase B
 * N=500 LongMemEval-S measurements:
 *
 * - {@link MINIMIZE_COST_TABLE}: cheapest Pareto-dominant backend per
 *   category. Pays the OM premium only on multi-session and
 *   single-session-preference (the categories where the architectural lift
 *   exceeds the cost premium).
 * - {@link BALANCED_TABLE}: trades modest cost for large latency wins on
 *   knowledge-update and temporal-reasoning.
 * - {@link MAXIMIZE_ACCURACY_TABLE}: highest-accuracy backend per category;
 *   ties broken by cost. v2 (post-Phase-B-2026-04-24) routes
 *   temporal-reasoning back to canonical-hybrid after Phase B revealed the
 *   v1 routing's accuracy gain was within CI noise but paid OM ingest cost.
 *
 * **Augmented routing (2026-04-26):** The {@link AugmentedRoutingTable}
 * extends the basic dispatch contract with an orthogonal axis — a
 * per-category {@link RetrievalConfigId} pick — so the router can
 * dispatch on (backend × retrieval-config) rather than backend alone.
 * The {@link MINIMIZE_COST_AUGMENTED_TABLE} preset is calibrated from
 * the LongMemEval-M Phase A N=54 ablation matrix (2026-04-26).
