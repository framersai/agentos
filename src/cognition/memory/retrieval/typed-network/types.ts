 * facts), Experience (first-person biographical), Opinion (claims with
 * confidence < 1), Observation (preference-neutral entity summaries).
 *
 * The schema follows Hindsight paper Equation 1
 * (arxiv.org/html/2512.12818v1 §2.1):
 *
 *   f = (u, b, t, v, τs, τe, τm, ℓ, c, x)
 *
 * mapped to TypeScript field names below. See spec
 * `packages/agentos-bench/docs/specs/2026-04-26-hindsight-4network-observer-design.md`
 * §2.1-§2.2 for the verbatim definition.
