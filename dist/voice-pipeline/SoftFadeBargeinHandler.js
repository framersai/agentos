/**
 * @module voice-pipeline/SoftFadeBargeinHandler
 *
 * Implements a three-tier soft-fade barge-in policy that maps detected speech
 * duration to one of three actions: ignore, pause (with fade-out), or cancel.
 *
 * ## Three-tier logic
 *
 * The handler divides the speech duration axis into three regions:
 *
 * ```
 *   0 ms                ignoreMs              cancelMs
 *   |-------- ignore --------|-------- pause --------|-------- cancel -------->
 *          (noise)              (fade-out)              (hard stop)
 * ```
 *
 * | Region                          | Action   | Rationale                                     |
 * |---------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
 * | `speechDurationMs < ignoreMs`   | `ignore` | Too short to be intentional (noise, breath).  |
 * | `ignoreMs <= speech < cancelMs` | `pause`  | Probably intentional; fade out gracefully.     |
 * | `speechDurationMs >= cancelMs`  | `cancel` | Definitely intentional; stop immediately.      |
 *
 * ## Configurable thresholds
 *
 * - **`ignoreMs`** (default 100 ms): The noise floor. Anything shorter than
 *   this is dismissed. Set lower in quiet environments, higher in noisy ones.
 *
 * - **`cancelMs`** (default 2,000 ms): The hard-stop ceiling. By this point,
 *   the user has clearly been speaking for a while and wants to take over.
 *   The pipeline should stop TTS immediately rather than fading.
 *
 * - **`fadeMs`** (default 200 ms): The duration of the audio fade-out applied
 *   during a `'pause'` action. Shorter fades (100 ms) feel snappier; longer
 *   fades (300+ ms) feel smoother but delay the user's ability to be heard.
 *
 * ## When to use soft-fade vs hard-cut
 *
 * Soft-fade is preferred when:
 * - The environment is noisy and false barge-in detections are common.
 * - The conversation is measured/educational and abrupt cuts feel jarring.
 * - The TTS voice has long trailing prosody that benefits from a fade.
 *
 * Use {@link HardCutBargeinHandler} when:
 * - The conversation is fast-paced (customer support, command interfaces).
 * - Audio quality is high and false positives are rare.
 * - Minimal interruption latency is critical.
 *
 * @see {@link HardCutBargeinHandler} for the binary hard-cut alternative.
 * @see {@link IBargeinHandler} for the interface contract.

/**
 * Barge-in handler that applies a three-tier soft-fade strategy.
 *
 * The handler is stateless -- each `handleBargein` call is evaluated
 * independently with no memory of previous barge-in events.
 *
 * @see {@link IBargeinHandler} for the interface contract.
 * @see {@link HardCutBargeinHandler} for the binary hard-cut alternative.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const handler = new SoftFadeBargeinHandler({ ignoreMs: 80, cancelMs: 1500, fadeMs: 150 });
 *
 * handler.handleBargein({ speechDurationMs: 30, ... });   // -> { type: 'ignore' }
 * handler.handleBargein({ speechDurationMs: 500, ... });  // -> { type: 'pause', fadeMs: 150 }
 * handler.handleBargein({ speechDurationMs: 1600, ... }); // -> { type: 'cancel', injectMarker: '[interrupted]' }
 * ```
